<p>WCFactory is short for Web component factory. It's tooling that automates the need to configure and understand...</p>
<ul><li>Yarn Workspaces</li>
<li>Lerna monorepos</li>
<li>Build routines for web components</li>
<li>Building and sustaining web component libraries</li>
<li>Polyfills and dependencies to get started</li>
<li>Publishing elements to <a href="https://webcomponents.org/">webcomponents.org</a>
 and <a href="https://npmjs.com">npmjs.com</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WCFactory was built and maintained by the Penn State ELMS: Learning Network community. You can see things we've built with this tooling using this website itself. This website though is an example of what's possible with web components and the factory -- this site is built using <a href="https://haxtheweb.org/">HAXcms</a>
 which is entirely composed of <a href="https://www.webcomponents.org/author/elmsln">web component factory generated elements</a>
 from a <a href="https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents">single monorepo</a>
